## Interesting Piece of Code:
``` java
// Being able to search by dates including month/year to date and previous month/year
    public static List<Transaction> searchByDate(List<Transaction> transactions, LocalDate start, LocalDate end) {
        List<Transaction> filteredReports = new ArrayList<>();

        for(Transaction t : transactions) {
            if((t.getDate().isAfter(start) || t.getDate().isEqual(start)) && (t.getDate().isBefore(end) || t.getDate().isEqual(end))) {
                filteredReports.add(t); // Includes the first and last days of the month
            }
        }
        return filteredReports;
    }
```
This code shows how I handled showing month/year to date and previous month/year.

In my first attempt, it would not count the first and last days of a month because it was only (t.getDate().isAfter(start) && t.getDate().isBefore(end)) which only included dates between the start and end. But by adding t.getDate().isEqual(start) and t.getDate().isEqual(end), it includes the start and end date now.
